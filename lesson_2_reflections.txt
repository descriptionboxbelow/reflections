What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a repo adds to your project's root folder a hidden folder
containing the necessary tools Git is using to track changes.
If I dont initialize a repo, Git won't be tracking my changes, I won't
be able to use Git's functionalities.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repo?
What value do you think it offers?
The working directory is related to what is happening on my local machine.
The repo is what happens when I commit my changes from local machine to Git.
The staging area is a limbo space between the two, possibly allowing me to
prepare my future commits before I go online and actually commit to the Git
system.
