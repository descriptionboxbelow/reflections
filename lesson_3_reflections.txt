When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local ?
  I will use a remote repository for any public or collaborative project I am working on.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Because my remote repository might be updated or altered by collaborators.
  I would want to be aware if new commits have been made on the project since
  my last commit.
