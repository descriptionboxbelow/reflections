When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local ?
  I will use a remote repository for any public or collaborative project I am working on.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Because my remote repository might be updated or altered by collaborators.
  I would want to be aware if new commits have been made on the project since
  my last commit.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?
  forks: A copy of someone else's GitHub project under my GitHub username.
  forks exist first & foremost on GitHub (server side)
  clone: A copy of a repository (not necesarily mine) on my local machine.
  When forking with the idea of modifying a repo, I'll first have to clone it
  on my machine.
  branches: Within the same repo, branches are created to test new/experimental
  features not present in the master branch.

  What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
  stored locally?
  The benefit is having a local copy is being able to work on the project when
  offline. You can then merge remote changes when you come back online.
